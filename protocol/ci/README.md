# Continous Integration Testing

Continous integration is performed via [Codeship](http://codeship.com/).

Here are some guidelines for developing with testing in mind.

* Push commits regularly to be tested.
* Make the build self-testing.
* Test in a clone of the production environment.
* Keep the builds fast.
