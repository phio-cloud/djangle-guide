# Software
Below are some freeware tools that help simplify and streamline the development process.


## iTerm
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is a terminal replacement with themes, autocomplete, search, and various hotkeys. It is an essential tool for the modern developer. 
The [Material Design Theme](https://github.com/MartinSeeler/iterm2-material-design) for iTerm2 is highly recommended for its high-contrasting colors that allows the user to easily distinguish between items.


## Sublime Text
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is an easy to use text editor with plugin availability and basic IDE capabilities for various languages. 
It is an exceptionally useful tool for lightning-fast regex/search/find-replace of large files.


## PyCharm

We use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) as our primary IDE, as it also contains support for HTML, JavaScript/TypeScript, C, Docker, and various other languages and filetypes. 
It's capabilities extend far beyond Python, which allows us to develop mixed projects efficiently.

Import [these settings](/style/python/settings.jar) to maintain uniformity between our team's code.


## Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) is a powerful and easy-to-use API management and testing tool.


## Firefox
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is one of the highest recommended browsers for developers. 
It touts higher performance, a lower memory fingerprint, a considerable extensions library, and various other features that help reduce frustration and increase productivity.


## Chrome
For those that are averse to Firefox, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is easily the second best option available for developers for many of the same reasons above for Firefox.
