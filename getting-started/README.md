# Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install or update multiple packages. 
Please follow the guides below to make sure your environment is properly configured!


## Homebrew
Homebrew is an essential package manager if you're developing on a MacOS machine, and will be used to install and update the various packages below. 
Please follow the guide [here](https://brew.sh/) to install it.


## Zsh
As of MacOS 10.15 Catalina, Bash will no longer be the default shell. 
Fortunately, Zsh has a lot of [awesome capabilities](https://github.com/hmml/awesome-zsh) that Bash lacks, which makes the switch well worth it.
To ensure you have the latest version of Zsh on your machine, run:

`brew install zsh`

To easily manage your Zsh configuration in the future, install Oh My Zsh by following the guide [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

Follow our Shell style guide [here](../style/shell) after completing the installation of all of the below.


## Python
We'll be using Python 3.7 - use Conda/Miniconda as our Python package/envrionment management system. 
Follow the Miniconda installation guide [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Follow our Python style guide [here](../style/python) after completing the installation of all of the below.

If you have grasped the basics of Python and want to learn some intermediate concepts, [this guide](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/index.html) introduces some fantastic features that Python has to offer.


## Docker
Multiple systems we have developed rely on Docker to ensure a seamless development process between team members.

To install Docker on your machine, please follow the instructions [here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).
This installs both Docker Desktop, and Docker Compose.


## Node.js
Node.js is an exceptionally useful JavaScript package manager.
Node.js can be installed via Homebrew via the command:

`brew install node`

If you have Node.js installed, but not via Homebrew, it is highly recommended that you uninstall that version and install via Homebrew to avoid conflicts down the line.


## TypeScript
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) is used to develop application-scale JavaScript projects and allows us to rapidly develop streamlined frontend applications.

After installing Node.js, TypeScript can be installed using:

`npm install -g typescript`


## Software
For some fantastic software recommendations, please see [this guide](./software).
